so in gitbash , we can find anything using 
find [path] -[name] or -[iname]  here i makes the name case insensitive or -[type d] for directory -[type f] for file and [expression]  here expression is the actual name of the text or file or directory
mv is used for both renaming as well as moving the files and folders
mv 'original name' 'new name'  
mv 'original.txt' './capy'  this code moves the file called original.txt into a directory called capy
//but for moving the folders
mv -r ./geography_game ./capy    //this code moves the folder called geography_game into capy here -r stands for recursively copying
