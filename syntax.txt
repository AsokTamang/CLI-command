so in gitbash , we can find anything using 
find [path] -[name] or -[iname]  here i makes the name case insensitive or -[type d] for directory -[type f] for file and [expression]  here expression is the actual name of the text or file or directory
mv is used for both renaming as well as moving the files and folders
mv 'original name' 'new name'  
mv 'original.txt' './capy'  this code moves the file called original.txt into a directory called capy
//but for moving the folders
mv -r ./geography_game ./capy    //this code moves the folder called geography_game into capy here -r stands for recursively copying



for searching the pattern in a file, we use a command called grep which stands for 
grep = globalsearch for regular expression print margin lines


//USEFUL OPTIONS
-n = for showing the line numbers
-i = for making case insensitive
-r = for searching recursively


//for replacing the content
sed 's/oldpattern/newpattern' [filename]  here sed stands for stream editor   and s stands for searching the old pattern first then replacing with the new pattern
g-for global
I-for case insensitive
sed -i 's/oldpattern/newpattern' [filename]   here -i means modifying the file


//and also we can replace the pattern using sed and put the entire code in a new file using > code 
sed 's/oldpattern/newpattern' [filename*] > [newfile]  here * stands for searching the pattern in the whole file called [newfile]

//here wc stands for word count and we use the code wc [filname] for counting the words in a filename 


//sorting method, we can code sort [filename] inorder to sort the file ,
//by default the sorting method is based on alphabetic order from A-Z 
//we also have variety of options for sorting ,
//-n for numeric sorting based on 1 to any numbers 
and //-r for reverse sorting from [Z-A]


//and we can also remove the duplicates in the file using the code uniq [filename]
