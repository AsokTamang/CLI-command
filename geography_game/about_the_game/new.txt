//here we have sorted the file called team_members.txt using sort and then removed the duplicates using uniq and redirected here 
//the code is like this
 - sort team_members.txt | uniq > new.txt       
 | is the symbol of pipe


//but for the empty file , we just code rm 'any.js'
//so -r means the recursive as we use rm -r 'any.js' for deleting the nonempty file called any.js
